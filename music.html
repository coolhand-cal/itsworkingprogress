                                        <p> I am 28 years old. I was born and raised In Baltimore Maryland, Life was often chaotic growing up with 13 people in one house. Music was my escape and, in some ways, 
                                            I feel like it helped raise me. I would Sit on my roof with my headphones on and J.  Cole or another artist would perfectly capture what I was struggling with like shining
                                             a light in the dark. I admire the artist as much as I do the art. How they can step on stage grab the mic and speak my heart, or at least a part. So here I stand trying to
                                              Finnish what they started. Nas inspired me with his lyrics. Jay Z taught me about the streets and what to avoid. Lupe fiasco expanded my mind and showed me the negative 
                                              aspects of the game, J. Cole was my Big Bro preparing me for the world. Now its My turn. I have been writing Since 16 years old. I Took my time and paid my dues and now 
                                              I am ready to leave my mark on the game and shine a light into the darkness with my music.
