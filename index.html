            <p> Welcome! Itâ€™s a Great day to Grind.  My name is Calvin Croxton and its Working Progress. I am a work in progress, 
            I am working to achieve progress, and I achieve progress through hard work. That work takes many forms. 
            Despite the troubling times we live in I believe we are headed for a renaissance and that calls for a renaissance man. 
            I Put up this website to both highlight and provide a lasting account for my work, to express myself, 
            to pass on knowledge and information I have acquired, and to spark and be a part of conversations that lead to positive action.
             Please Stay and take a look around. If you like what you see be sure to sign up for email alerts I will be putting up new content each 
             and every week.
