                            <p>We all learn from our experiences. Over time our experiences help us see patterns and predict what may happen and why.
                                We desire to predict future circumstances. The better our observational and analytical skills the better our predictions 
                                become. Even though our experiences play a central role they are not the only factor. There are other influences including 
                                Tradition and authority that have a more significant impact on what we consider truth.</p>

                        <section class="feature-content">
                            
                            <h4>This is about knowing</h4>
                             <p> Not so much what we know but how we know it. I am not talking about things in a theoretical or philosophical 
                                  but literally how we know what we know and why we accept it as truth. For example Most people would agree that the earth is round 
                                  but how do you actually know? Maybe a teacher or a parent told you or you read it in a textbook when you were a child.<p>
                                
                            <p>We inherit a culture from our ancestors. Along with that comes accepted views of the world.Everybody knows the earth is round right? 
                                It’s common sense. We don’t even question it. But how do we know? Unless you hop on a rocket and get a look for yourself, chances are 
                                you got this information from someone else and took it as truth.  “Most of what we know is a matter of agreement and belief. Little of 
                                it is based on personal experience and discovery. A big part of growing up in any society is the process of learning to accept what 
                                others ‘know’ is so. If you don’t know these things you can’t really be a part of the group” 1    <p>
                                                                     
                            <p> We are taught to just accept things and not question it. If you were to start asking, is the world really round? People would look at 
                                you like you are crazy. Push it too far and you might find yourself waking up to padded walls everyday. We know some things through our 
                                own experience and others by way of tradition and experts. When experience conflicts with what everyone knows there is a good chance we
                                 will surrender our experience in favor of agreement. <p>

                            </section>
                                
                            <p>The same things we think of as common sense today would be considered crazy by our ancestors. Galileo Galilei, a physicist and astronomer, 
                                challenged the belief at the time that the earth was flat. His Views landed him in hot water with the church not once but twice! In 1616, 
                                he had been forbidden from holding or defending his belief. In 1633 he was tried for heresy.2 <p>
                                
                            <p>For me it is natural to seek growth and challenge my understanding. I learned over time that this sort of mindset is not common nor encouraged.
                                Why must we fight so hard for what we know is right? Why are people willing to so easily discredit themselves and toss aside their experiences 
                                in favor of society's version of the truth? It angered me at times witnessing peoples willful ignorance. My emotions blinded me and prevented me 
                                from understanding the role of tradition. Tradition has its advantages. “ By accepting what everybody knows, we avoid the overwhelming task of 
                                starting From scratch in our search for regularities and understanding “1 <p>

                                <p>Dr Shirley Jackson</p>
                      
                            </section>
                                     
                            <p>Imagine if we had to literally reinvent the wheel every generation. The advances we have today would not be possible. One could look at a gifted 
                                mind such as Elijah Mccoy or Dr Shirley Jackson and think that their genius is unique and completely original. After all, without Dr. Jackson we 
                                might not have the touch tone telephone, caller id, or call waiting3. Still these accomplishments would not be possible without those who paved 
                                the way. In the words of sir Issac Newton ` If i have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulder of giants.`  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                      
                            <p>Tradition has its role. In the search for new knowledge it serves as an excellent starting point However in order for us to build on that foundation 
                                we have to be brave enough to seek out new understanding even if it means risking becoming the outcast for a time. Still this brings me back to the
                                question of how to determine what is truth? New knowledge appears everyday. With advances in technology and the advent of social media everyone has
                                a platform to speak their views and many of them speak on their opinions as if it were the gospel. Whether we chose to believe them or not often depends 
                                on their status. You're more likely to believe health advice from Your doctor  than your great aunt sue. Taking into account the status of the source 
                                is helpful in filtering information but just as with tradition there are pros and cons. <p>
                                
                            <p>It makes sense to listen to one who has special training, expertise or credentials in their field (i.e a law advice from a lawyer). Still we must take 
                                into account that even experts make mistakes. Our understanding can also be limited when we listen to experts who are speaking outside of their field. 
                                Such as taking nutritional advice from a math teacher. The marketing industry takes full advantage of this. Many of us have at one time or another 
                                purchased a product or service because it was endorsed by a celebrity we like or trust even if the product is more expensive than its competitors. 
                                More often than not the person representing the product knows little about the inner workings of the company and is just saying what they were paid to say. <p>
                                
                            <p> Human inquiry is not perfect. I started by asking how is it that we know what we know. I Took a look at the two most common ways: Tradition (what is passed on to us)
                                 and Authority (wisdom of the experts). I see that neither is perfect. They can provide us with a good starting point for conversation but if we rely too heavily on 
                                 either one we may be led astray. I searched for answers and instead found more questions. It is clear to me that we must at times seek out our own understanding. 
                                 In a future article i will take a look at some of the roadblocks we face as we set out to learn for ourselves and suggest solutions to those problems. <p>
